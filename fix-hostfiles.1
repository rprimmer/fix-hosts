.TH fix-hostfiles.sh 1
.SH NAME
fix-hostfiles.sh \- Prepare /etc/hosts for hblock(1) 
.SH USAGE
.B fix-hostfiles.sh [OPTIONS] <ACTION>
.SH DESCRIPTION
hblock(1) is a shell script (available on homebrew) that blocks ads, beacons and malware sites. 
It does this by editing /etc/hosts and setting the IP address for such sites to 0.0.0.0.
The issue is that hblock sometimes adds sites to /etc/hosts that are needed.
This script fixes such issues by adding good DNS hosts to the exclusion list (/etc/hblock/allow.list)
and removing the corresponding entry from /etc/hosts. It will also optionally flush the DNS cache 
and restart the mDNSResponder daemon.
